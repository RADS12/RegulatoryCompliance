API Documentation: Enhance Swagger with XML comments, endpoint descriptions, and example requests/responses.
Validation: Add model validation using data annotations or FluentValidation for request models.
Error Handling: Implement global exception handling and standardized error responses (e.g., ProblemDetails).
Logging: Integrate structured logging (e.g., Serilog) for better diagnostics and monitoring.
Unit & Integration Tests: Add automated tests for controllers, services, and business logic.
Authentication & Authorization: Secure endpoints using JWT, OAuth, or Identity.
Configuration Management: Use strongly-typed configuration and secrets management for sensitive data.
Health Checks: Add health check endpoints for monitoring service status.
Performance: Profile and optimize critical code paths; consider caching for expensive operations.
CI/CD: Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
Code Quality: Use analyzers, linters, and code formatting tools to maintain code quality.
Dependency Injection: Review and optimize service lifetimes and registrations.
OpenAPI Security: Add security definitions to Swagger for testing protected endpoints.
