# App Enhancements

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for controllers, services, and business logic using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
2. **API Documentation**: Expand Swagger with XML comments, endpoint descriptions, and example requests/responses.
3. **Input Validation**: Ensure all request models use data annotations or FluentValidation for robust validation.
4. **Error Handling**: Continue refining global exception handling, including logging exceptions and returning standardized ProblemDetails.
5. **Structured Logging**: Use Serilog enrichers (e.g., for correlation IDs, user info) and configure log sinks (file, Seq, etc.) for better diagnostics.
6. **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure endpoints with JWT, OAuth, or ASP.NET Identity if not already done.
7. **Configuration & Secrets Management**: Use environment variables and secret stores for sensitive data.
8. **Health Checks & Monitoring**: Add health check endpoints and integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Application Insights).
9. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize critical code paths; add caching where appropriate.
10. **CI/CD Automation**: Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
11. **Code Quality Tools**: Integrate analyzers, linters, and code formatters to maintain high code quality.
12. **Dependency Injection Review**: Ensure service lifetimes and registrations are optimal.
13. **OpenAPI Security**: Add security definitions to Swagger for testing protected endpoints.
14. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README and developer docs for onboarding and usage.
