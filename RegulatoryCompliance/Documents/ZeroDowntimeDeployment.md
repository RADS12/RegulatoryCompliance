# Zero-Downtime Deployments for RegulatoryCompliance

This guide explains how to achieve zero-downtime deployments for your .NET application using deployment slots (Azure App Service) and blue-green deployments (cloud-agnostic).

---

## 1. Azure App Service Deployment Slots

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Create a Staging Slot**
   - In Azure Portal, go to your App Service.
   - Under "Deployment slots", add a new slot (e.g., `staging`).
   - Deploy your new version to the staging slot.
2. **Validate in Staging**
   - Test your app using the staging slot URL.
3. **Swap Slots**
   - When ready, swap staging with production. Azure handles the swap with no downtime.

**Sample Azure DevOps Pipeline YAML:**
```yaml
- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your-subscription>'
    appName: '<your-app-name>'
    deployToSlotOrASE: true
    resourceGroupName: '<your-resource-group>'
    slotName: 'staging'
    package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop/*.zip'
- task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your-subscription>'
    Action: 'Swap Slots'
    WebAppName: '<your-app-name>'
    ResourceGroupName: '<your-resource-group>'
    SourceSlot: 'staging'
    TargetSlot: 'production'
```

## 2. Blue-Green Deployment (Cloud Agnostic)

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Provision Two Environments**
   - "Blue" (live) and "Green" (new).
2. **Deploy to Green**
   - Deploy your new version to the green environment.
   - Run tests and validation.
3. **Switch Traffic**
   - Update your load balancer or DNS to route traffic from blue to green.
   - The switch is instant and users experience no downtime.
4. **Rollback**
   - If issues occur, switch traffic back to blue.

## 3. GitHub Actions Example (Azure Web App Slot)

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Publish to Staging Slot
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: '<your-app-name>'
          slot-name: 'staging'
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE }}
          package: ./publish
      - name: Swap Slots
        run: az webapp deployment slot swap --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-app-name> --slot staging --target-slot production
```

## 4. Best Practices
- Always validate in the staging/green environment before swapping or switching traffic.
- Automate deployment and swap/switch steps in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor health checks and logs during and after deployment.
- Use environment variables and secrets for configuration.
